RuntimeError: jaxlib/cuda/versions_helpers.cc:113: operation cuInit(0) failed: Unknown CUDA error 303; cuGetErrorName failed. This probably means that JAX was unable to load the CUDA libraries.

TypeError: Error interpreting argument to <function main.<locals>.predict_mean at 0x7f5e98459a80> as an abstract array. The problematic value is of type <class 'function'> and was passed to the function at path model.full_shared_mlp.activation.
This typically means that a jit-wrapped function was called with a non-array argument, and this argument was not marked as static using the static_argnums or static_argnames parameters of jax.jit.

For simplicity, JAX has removed its internal frames from the traceback of the following exception. Set JAX_TRACEBACK_FILTERING=off to include these.
