# Dmipy-JAX Restricted Models Benchmark
Device: TFRT_CPU_0
| Model | JIT Time (s) | 100k Voxels Time (ms) | Throughput (Voxels/s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Restricted Cylinder (Soderman) | FAILED | vmap is only supported for the pure_callback primitive when vmap_method is one of 'sequential', 'sequential_unrolled', 'expand_dims', 'broadcast_all', or 'legacy_vectorized'. Got vmap_method=None. | - |
| Restricted Cylinder (Callaghan, N=20) | FAILED | vmap is only supported for the pure_callback primitive when vmap_method is one of 'sequential', 'sequential_unrolled', 'expand_dims', 'broadcast_all', or 'legacy_vectorized'. Got vmap_method=None. | - |
| Sphere (Stejskal-Tanner) | 0.0727 | 5.35 | 1.87e+07 |
| Sphere (Callaghan, N=20) | FAILED | SphereCallaghan requires 'qvalues' or bvals+timing. | - |
